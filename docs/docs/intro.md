# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**An AI-Native Textbook for Building Intelligent Embodied Systems**

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This course teaches you to build intelligent robotic systems that operate in the physical world, from foundational concepts to complete voice-commanded humanoid robots.

## What You Will Learn

This textbook takes you on a journey from understanding what makes physical AI unique to building complete humanoid systems:

- **Module 1: Physical AI Foundations** — Understand embodied intelligence, sensors, actuators, and the physical constraints that govern real-world robotics
- **Module 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals** — Master the robotic operating system that connects perception to action
- **Module 3: Simulation & Digital Twin** — Build and test robots in physics-accurate virtual environments
- **Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac Ecosystem** — Leverage GPU-accelerated simulation and perception for humanoid robotics
- **Module 5: Vision-Language-Action** — Integrate speech recognition, language models, and vision systems into robotic control
- **Capstone: Integrated Humanoid System** — Synthesize all modules into a complete voice-commanded humanoid robot

## Course Philosophy

This course is built on three core principles:

### 1. Physical Grounding First

Every concept in this textbook is grounded in physical reality. We don't teach software abstractions in isolation—we always connect them to the sensors that produce data, the actuators that create motion, and the physical constraints that govern what's possible.

### 2. Capability-Based Learning

Each chapter gives you a concrete capability. You won't just "learn about" topics—you will **be able to do** specific things. Every learning objective is stated as "Students can..." rather than "Students will learn..."

### 3. Progressive Autonomy

Early modules guide you through explicit steps. Later modules require design decisions. The capstone demands tradeoff reasoning. You'll grow from following instructions to making architectural choices.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:

- **Python Programming** — Intermediate level (classes, functions, modules, debugging)
- **Basic Robotics Concepts** — Know what sensors and actuators are conceptually
- **Linear Algebra Basics** — Matrix multiplication, vectors, coordinate systems
- **Linux Command Line** — Basic navigation and file operations
- **Scientific Thinking** — Understanding of measurement, error, and uncertainty

## Course Duration

- **17 weeks** total
- **5 Modules** (2-3 weeks each)
- **1 Capstone** (3 weeks)
- **Approximately 8-10 hours per week**

## Hardware Requirements

| Stage | Hardware | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Modules 1-3 | Standard laptop/desktop | Linux recommended |
| Modules 4-5 | NVIDIA RTX 2070+ GPU | Required for Isaac Sim |
| Capstone | NVIDIA RTX 3070+ recommended | For VLM inference |

Cloud alternatives are provided for students without local GPU access.

## How to Use This Textbook

1. **Follow the module order** — Each module builds on previous ones
2. **Complete the exercises** — Hands-on practice is essential
3. **Check your understanding** — Use the self-assessment questions
4. **Reference the glossary** — Technical terms are defined consistently
5. **Review prerequisites** — If you're stuck, check the prerequisite chapter

## Getting Started

Ready to begin? Start with [Module 1: Physical AI Foundations](/module-1) to understand what makes robotics in the physical world fundamentally different from software development.
