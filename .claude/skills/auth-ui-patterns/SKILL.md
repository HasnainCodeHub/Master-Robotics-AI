# auth-ui-patterns

## Purpose
Standardize how authentication flows appear and behave in the user interface.

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Implementing login or signup flows
- Protecting content behind authentication
- Redirecting users based on auth state

## How It Works
- Separates authentication routes from content routes
- Prevents auth forms from rendering as uncontrolled overlays
- Enforces explicit login-required messaging
- Coordinates UI state with authentication state

## Output
- Professional authentication UX
- Clear access boundaries
- Predictable login and logout behavior
