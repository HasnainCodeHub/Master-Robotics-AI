# state-management

## Purpose
Manage shared frontend state in a predictable and debuggable way.

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Managing authentication state
- Sharing data across components
- Handling loading and error states

## How It Works
- Enforces single source of truth
- Defines explicit state transitions
- Prevents implicit cross-component dependencies
- Separates UI state from server state

## Output
- Consistent UI updates
- Predictable application behavior
- Easier debugging
