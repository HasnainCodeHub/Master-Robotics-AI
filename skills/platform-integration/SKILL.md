# platform-integration

## Purpose
Safely connect frontend systems to backend APIs and platform services.

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Calling backend APIs
- Integrating authentication services
- Connecting chat or AI endpoints

## How It Works
- Enforces API contract alignment
- Handles backend errors explicitly
- Prevents tight coupling between UI and backend internals

## Output
- Reliable API communication
- Graceful error handling
- Maintainable integration patterns
